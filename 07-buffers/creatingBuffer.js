/*
Buffer objects are used to represent a fixed-length sequence of bytes. Many Node.js APIs support Buffers.
The Buffer class is a subclass of JavaScript's Uint8Array class and extends it with methods that cover additional use cases.
Node.js APIs accept plain Uint8Arrays wherever Buffers are supported as well.

The Buffer class is within the global scope, making it unlikely that one would need to ever use require('buffer').Buffer.
